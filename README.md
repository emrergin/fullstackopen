### What I learned in Part 1
- Anecdotes is the first project in which I used `Uint8Array`.
- Object and Array mutations need extra care under state events.

## Part 2 Communicating with server
The task for this part required me to polish the courseinfo app from earlier. Furthermore, I also made a phonebook with data save and a search field.

### What I learned in Part 2
- I had used `reduce` before, but this is the first time I fully understood its versatility.
- I finally grasped the use of using functions as paramters or props, which is really helpful when working with components that includes event handlers.
- When rendering a list, `map` needs a wrapping `div` or a `Fragment`.
- Never call a component from itself, recursive components are never a good idea.
